### Backend:
Django Framework: The project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- User Authentication: Django's built-in authentication system is leveraged to handle user login, logout, and session management securely.
- Session Management: Users are kept logged in across sessions, ensuring they can navigate the site without needing to re-authenticate frequently.
- Email Confirmation: Upon registration, users receive an email containing a confirmation link to verify their account. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that the registered email is valid and owned by the user.

## Features:

### Registration:
- Users can create an account by providing their username, first name, last name, email, and password. The registration form includes validation to ensure that the entered data meets required standards.
- After registration, users receive a confirmation email to verify their account before they can log in.

### Login:
- Registered users can log in using their credentials. The login form includes validation to ensure that the username and password are correctly entered.
- If the credentials are incorrect, the system provides appropriate error messages.

### Email Confirmation:
- After registering, users must confirm their email address through a link sent to their email. This feature helps to verify the user's identity and ensure that the email address provided is valid.

### Logout:
- Authenticated users have the option to log out, which terminates their session and ensures that their account is secure when not in use.
